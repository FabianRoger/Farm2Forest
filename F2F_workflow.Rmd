### Workflow

![](Internal_F2F_meeting_04_20-figure/F2F_workflow.jpeg)


### Activities in Agripolis

+ What activities do we want to include
+ How do we include them
+ What data do we need for that and where / how do we get it? 
+ Do we need to add new actors?

can we focus on "normal forestry", i.e. spruce with 70 year rotation period 
but maybe intensification of underused forest 

### Typical farms

+ Once we have selected 'typical farms' how do we implement that in Agripolis
+ What additional information do we need to characterize Farms by new activities
+ some measure of how isolated farms are 
+ check how distributed dif

### Habitat mapping

+ Could we get at habitat conversion by looking which blocks are lost from block-database and see what they are now?

### Scenarios

+ cap-reform.eu
+ delegating responsability to member states gives more lee-way for "interesting" scenarios
+ renationalization of agricultural policy


How to define scanrios: 
+ Skype meeting with JBV after Summer (September) [David, Torbjörn, who else, Näringsdepartementet?] 
  + what are the current reflection within Sweden
  + possibility of regional policies
  + possibility of moving money (up to 30%?) to pillar 2 (where the environmental schemes live)
  + Who are the different actors
  
  Important actors:
  + Farmers organizations
  + environmental interest groups (but not much influence)
  +
  
Possibility to interview 

face-to-face or phone interview with standardized Questions + some open questions


Strategy:

1) define scenarios with JBV
2)
