### Workflow

![](Internal_F2F_meeting_04_20-figure/F2F_workflow.jpeg)


### Activities in Agripolis

+ What activities do we want to include
+ How do we include them
+ What data do we need for that and where / how do we get it? 
+ Do we need to add new actors?

### Typical farms

+ Once we have selected 'typical farms' how do we implement that in Agripolis
+ What additional information do we need to characterize Farms by new activities

### Habitat mapping

+ Could we get at habitat conversion by looking which blocks are lost from block-database and see what they are now?

### Scenarios

+ Test
